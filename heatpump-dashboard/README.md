# CS 498 End-to-End Data Science MP 01 (sp24) repo for NetID: adrian11

This is the frist MP for CS 498 End-To-End Data Science. This MP tasked us with taking raw data that included much information and clean it so that it only had the city, state, latitude, and longitude. Then we were tasked with making a reactive front-end dashboard that allowed for the user view weather data based on the city so that one can gauge whether it is worth installing a heat pump in your home

#### How To View:

1. Copy this repositiory, then make sure to have uv installed create a virtual environment, download all the packages into the virtual environment. Then inside the heatpump-dashboard folder you should be able to do "shiny run" and the application will compile and run
2. Click on this [link](https://adrianlara.shinyapps.io/heat_pump_efficiency/) to view the live application, removing the need to download anything

Hello this is a test!
